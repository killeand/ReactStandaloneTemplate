# React Standalone Template

## What is this?

This is a webpage that utilizes a few different technologies to become a standalone website application. It uses TailwindCSS and DaisyUI for simple style and design, Babel so you can use native ES6+ and JSX for your code, React for a rich user and development experience, React Router so you can have a multi-page website, Theme Change for a nice and easy transition between different css styles in DaisyUI (light and dark), and Bootstrap Icons for a nice css accessible icon set.

Of course, you don't have to use TailwindCSS, or React Router, or DaisyUI in your application. I am simply using them as a means to an end for this example. The primary purpose is to have an all in one React example that you can use the latest ecmascript and JSX via Babel conversion. And there inlies the primary purpose; all in one. No external files, just a single HTML file that pulls in resources to make your app work.
